# Insurance-Prediction
Machine learning  was applied to create a web application to predict the potential medical cost billed by health insurance.

Regression analysis was applied to the supplied dataset to determine what metrics affect hospital charges.

The web application can be found on Heroku at the following link:
https://insurance-prediction964.herokuapp.com/


* Insurance-Prediction.ipynb - Contains a Jupyter notebook for the machine learning model creation, and linear regression analysis on the dataset.
* insurance.csv - Is the dataset found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance
* app.py - Contains the python application to start the web server.


To run the application locally download or clone this repository. Make sure your machine has a python environment set up with the packages found in the requirements.txt. Then run the app.py. `python3 app.py`
